						<p> In light of the “Belt and Road” initiative, China is expected to have more exchanges and cooperations with over 60 countries joining in the course. Hence breaking the language barrier and reducing communication cost are the top priorities in facilitating exchanges. Meanwhile, machine translation has achieved great breakthroughs and advancement in the recent years with more technological companies coming up with high-performed translation software and hardware such as Google Translate, Youdao Translate, Sougou Translate, iFLYTEK easy trans 600 translation device, Fujitsu wearable speech translation device, Google Pixel Pods, etc., plus the media hype about human simultaneous interpreters will soon be replaced by machines, the author is eager to verify the capability and feasibility of machine translation. The research outcome is expected to provide useful guidance and reference to all students and teachers in the translation and interpreting major, translators and interpreters, translation companies and public who are in need of translation services. 
							</p> <p>
								At present, the domestic and international researches in this regard are mostly focusing on testing the accuracy of translation software and the operating mechanism behind machine translation. Few research about the hardware performance and the related information are mostly in the form of user product experiences, comments or video demo. However, the majority of these software and hardware adopt similar translation systems such as neural machine translation, etc, thus the researches on translation software can also be used as references in this research. As the author’s research will focus on testing the Chinese product iFLYTEK voice translation device, the user experiences are mostly collected from China and the feedbacks are mixed. On the other hand, international researches are prone to study the accuracy of a certain translation system in a certain field. In general, all these researches mostly deemed that machine translation has bright prospect.</p>
